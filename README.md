This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based approach to predict Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using vocal biomarkers. The dataset utilized for this study is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be accessed at this https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/174/parkinsons. This dataset comprises 195 biomedical voice measures collected from 31 individuals, including 23 with Parkinson’s Disease and 8 healthy individuals.  The goal of the project is to create a non-invasive, scalable diagnostic tool that aids in the early detection of Parkinson’s Disease. By analyzing vocal features such as jitter, shimmer, and noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR), machine learning models can differentiate between healthy individuals and those with PD.
